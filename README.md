# simpleGraph

The simpleGraph is a simple library for working with graphs.
 
It supports 2 types of graphs - directed and undirected with 3 operations:

addVertex - adds vertex to the graph
addEdge - adds edge to the graph
getPath - returns a list of edges between 2 vertices (path is not optimal)

Vertices are of a user defined type.
